== Concentrated Vanilla mod ==

Concentrated Vanilla mod is meant to enhance vanilla gameplay, and fix the worst bugs, imbalances, and other problematic areas without straying too far from vanilla experience.

== Installation ==

Installation - step 1 (all versions)

First, regardless of your version, find directory where medieval2.exe is located, and put all unpacked files (concentrated_vanilla.bat, concentrated_vanilla.cfg, and concentrated_vanilla directory) in the same directory.

If you're playing retail this directory should be something like C:\Program Files\Creative Assembly\Medieval 2 Total War . If you have Steam version, it should be something like C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Medieval 2 Total War.

If you have retail version, that's it. Double click on concentrated_vanilla.bat and go.
Installation - step 2 (Steam)

With Steam it's much harder because they added crappy launcher and broke modding.

I recommend removing the launcher completely. Delete Launcher.exe, make a copy of medieval2.exe and rename the copy as launcher.exe.

Then go to your Steam library, select Medieval 2 Total War, right click on it, select properties, Set launch options - type @concentrated_vanilla.cfg in the box, and confirm. Then when you start Medieval 2 Total War from Steam it will load the mod.
Installation - alternative step 2 (Steam)

I haven't actually tested it, but it should work, and is theoretically simpler.

Edit medieval2.cfg and paste this there:

    [features]
    mod = concentrated_vanilla

    Then start Medieval 2 as normally.
