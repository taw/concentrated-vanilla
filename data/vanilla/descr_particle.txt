;
;	This is the setup file for the various particle systems the game uses. The entries in
;	this file are here mostly for ease-of-editing the art content; the game requires all 
;	of them to be present, because various pieces of code add particles to the systems 
;	generated from these descriptions - ie the units push dust particles into the dust 
;	system
;
;	;					denotes a comment ...
;						
;	type				identifier of the particle system type
;						
;	action				there can be up to 8 of these, and they are applied in the order in which
;						they are specified - particle actions are the things which move, age and 
;						kill particles in the world... not all particle types need an action list
;
;						advance []
;						age_to_limit [float: maximum age in seconds]
;						expand [expansion rate in meters/second]
;						max_particles [integer : maximum number of particles in game]
;						accel_simple [float : in_x, in_y, in_z]
;						colour_shift [val to 255: red,green,blue start colour, red,green,blue end colour][float: transition time from particle birth]
;
;						these can appear in any order, and the order in which they are given is 
;						the order in which it is applied
;						
;	renderer			what type of particle renderer to use for these particles; this must be
;						one of the following, and note that each entry requires slightly different
;						parameters, all seperated by comma's:
;						
;						tri
;							no parameters
;						
;						quad
;							no parameters
;						
;						quad_fade
;							fade_in:	fraction of particle lifetime after birth spent fading in
;							fade_out:	fraction of particle lifetime before death spent fading out
;							alpha_key:	0-255 number which gives alpha draw threshold
;
;							fade_in_time + fade_out_time must be less than 1
;
;	renderer_class		class of rendering that the particle system falls into - this must be 
;						one of normal,blended,far
;
;	anim				this should be followed by three fields, as follows
;						
;							<number of frames>		more than 1 means an animated particle, 
;													0 is illegal
;							<frames per second>		number of animation frames per second, if 
;													not animated set to 0
;							loop, do_not_loop		wether to loop the animation or hold on the
;													final frame
;
;	random				the number of random texture frame tracks which are present... this allows you 
;						to set up a particle with an appearance chosen from several random alternates;
;						if there is animation present, the different alternate tracks all have to be the
;						same number of frames, and the uv's should be specified as follows:
;
;							(frame1) {alt1,alt2,altt3} , (frame2) {alt1,alt2,alt3} and so on
;						
;	texture				texture to use for this particle type
;
;	texture_frame		there can be many of these, as each specifies a single frame of uv coordinates
;						for the particle type; each statement should provide either 3 (if using the tri
;						renderer) or 4 (quad renderers) sets of uv coordinates on the line following
;
;						animated types will need as many frames as are stated in the 'anim' statement
;						random-choice particles will need as many sets per animation frame as specified
;						in the random statement above
