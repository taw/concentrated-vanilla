;	This file contains the item model linkages; it gets parsed on application
;	startup but is not otherwise referred to. The data format is thus:
;
;	;						indicates a comment ;-)
;
;	type					indicates a new model type, must be followed by id name string (phrase)
;	model_rigid				indicates a new model in the lod series, must be followed by file name with path and lod
;								range in m (no range supplied means maximum range - last mode including sprite)
;
;								all mesh model lods must be supplied in order, smallest distance (highest detail) first
