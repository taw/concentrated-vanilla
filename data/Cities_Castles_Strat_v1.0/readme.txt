# CITIES&CASTLES STRAT MODELS v.1.0 #
##############################





Brief Description: 
===============================================

- this is an update to my castle mini-mod, which now includes new cities as well. It will replace the Kingdoms vanilla cities and castles strat models with new ones.
It also includes new models for wooden castles, motte_and bailey and remodelled me and ne castles. 
 
  Levels castles: motte_and_bailey, wooden castle, castle, fortress, citadel.
  Levels cities: town, large town, city, large city, huge city.
  Cultures castles: north-european, south- european, east- european, middle- eastern, greek, teutonic.
  Cultures cities: north-european, south- european, east- european, middle- eastern.

New models have in average 30-50% more polys than original. To my experience strat MTW2 rendering engine can handle it without a problem if you have more or less decent machine.

- it should be compatible with all Kingdoms versions. Can be used with vanilla MTW2 as well with the exception of teutonic castles models ("Faction variants" does not work in MTW2).
Should be compatible with your saved game and with other mods as well as soon as they don’t modify strat models. 


NOTE OF CAUTION:
===================================================================

- A sample description_culture.txt included.
